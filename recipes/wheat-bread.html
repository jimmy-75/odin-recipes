        <ol>
          <li>Place the warm water in a large bowl and sprinkle the yeast on top. Set aside for 5 minutes to allow the yeast to proof.</li>
          <li>Add the honey and butter.</li>
          <li>Blend in 2 cups of the flour and the salt until moistened. Beat on medium speed for 3 minutes.<li>
          <li>Stir in an additional 1 1/4 to 1 3/4 cups flour, until dough pulls away cleanly from the sides of the bowl.</li>
          <li>Knead on floured surface, adding 1/2 to 3/4 cup additional flour, until dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.</li>
          <li>Place dough in large greased bowl and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise in warm place until doubled in size, 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
          <li>Lightly mist a 9x5-inch loaf pan with non-stick spray. </li>
          <li>Punch down the dough and shape it into a loaf.</li>
          <li>Place in prepared pan, cover loosely with greased plastic wrap, and let rise in warm place until doubled in size, 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. </li>
          <li>Uncover dough, and bake 40 to 45 minutes or until loaf sounds hollow when lightly tapped.</li>
