        <ol>
          <li>(One day in advance) Place the dried chickpeas and baking soda in a large bowl filled with water to cover the chickpeas by at least 2 inches. Soak overnight for 18 hours (longer  if the chickpeas are still too hard). When ready, drain the chickpeas completely and pat them dry.</li>
          <li>Add the chickpeas, herbs, onions, garlic and spices to the large bowl of a food processor fitted with a blade. Run the food processor 40 seconds at a time until all is well combined forming a the falafel mixture.</li>
          <li>Transfer the falafel mixture to a container and cover tightly. <u>Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or (up to one whole night) until ready to cook.</u></li>
          <li>Just before frying, add the baking powder and sesame seeds to the falafel mixture and stir with a spoon.</li>
          <li>Scoop tablespoonfuls of the falafel mixture and form into patties (Â½ inch in thickness each). It helps to have wet hands as you form the patties.</li>
          <li>Fill a medium saucepan 3 inches up with oil. Heat the oil on medium-high until it bubbles softly. Carefully drop the falafel patties in the oil, let them fry for about 3 to 5 minutes or so until crispy and medium brown on the outside. Avoid crowding the falafel in the saucepan, fry them in batches if necessary.</li>
          <li>Place the fried falafel patties in a colander or plate lined with paper towels to drain.</li>
          <li>Serve falafel hot next to other small plates; or assemble the falafel patties in pita bread with tahini or hummus, arugula, tomato and cucumbers. Enjoy!</li>
